We are finishing up the project this week. Our combined group is very close to having our final product and should have all our analysis completed by Tuesday and cleaned up by Thursday. My goal is to translate the area under the curve formula from the Quakers and apply it to our project as it seems they did it very effectively. I am very proud of our group and what we have accomplished this semester.

From this class, I've learned how hard collaboration is. I first didn't think it would be particularly hard, but as the semester went on, making sure people were on the same page and that groups would move in the same direction proved to be very hard. The social media methods to communicate were relatively effective. I wished we had higher attendance within our group to class because meeting in class is definitely a more effective way to organize and plan because of the difficulty of scheduling meetings outside of class.

Some of the problems that should be addressed in future class is defining and solidifying a concrete grading rubric, developing groups earlier on, allowing more teams to figure out their own strengths rather than assigning people roles early on, and having assignments that build skills throughout the semester.
