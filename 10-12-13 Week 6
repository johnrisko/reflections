reflections
===========

This week was the most challenging week in the class. I felt our presenation went releively smoothly especially considering we were the first group to present. It was particularly challenging since I was out of town for the weekend and we had to figure out ways to coordinate and get the project together. The most challenging aspect of the week was coordination and getting the code to be accessible and able torun by everyone in the group. We had problems running code on different group members' computers, but eventually solved it. 

One of the biggest challenges moving forward will be getting everyone up to the same page on Python. We did the project in R, but I think being able to use Python will make accessiblity and reproducibility easier. Going forward, I think we all need to improve on our communication methods (i.e. group messaging, office hours, etc.) and get on the same programming platform.
