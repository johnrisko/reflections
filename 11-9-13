===========

The past week resulted in a lot of progress in the group project. my team consists of Tay, Laura, and Disi. We are tackling the heart of the problem and all of us have the capabilities to approach the topic. Laura is organizing the entire class, Tay has the programming capabilities, Disi is in contact with Luen and is knowledgable about the project, and I help everyone with their projects. I am a big-picture generalist by nature so my role in the group fits to my strengths. What I can do more to contribute is supply my group with more knowledge on the materials, help Laura aggregate the material, and help Tay program. I also will aim to communicate our group's prgoress with a corresponding visualizer group. The addition of a data curator to our group is very helpful as it will facilitate the comuincation abilities in the class.
