===========

  We are progressing towards the end. I think we have only 3 classes left and we're in position to complete the project if we focus. My group is now collabprating with group 3 of the analyzers to make Luen's code more reproducible. This we have divided the work and are compiling the code to have prepared for Tuesday class.
  
  Some roadblocks have been getting everyone on the same page seeing that we have combined groups and haven't been able to get everyone to class on the same day. I do think that we are communicating via email and github effectively. Some suggestions to improve the class for next semester would be to create working groups earlier on, but not based on the visualizer-presenter-analyzer method. I think the only essential aspect is that everyone needs a programmer. Visualization is important but is directly related to the analyzing aspects. For presenting, I think most can communicate effectively enough to not need a seperate presenting group. I think groups can assign amongst themselves the roles of individuals within the groups.
