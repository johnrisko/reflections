The past week was highly eventful as our group finished our analysis of the ETAS model and are moving on to help other groups. Our new project is to help make the error plots written in Luen's code reproducible as well as help Teresa's group produce reproducible plots. To accomplish this, we combined groups 2 nd 3 of the analyzer groups. Our preliminary goals are to get everyone in the combined group caught to speed as there were a few absences in class and it is paramount to get everyone on the same page. Once we get everyone on the same page, the task should be relatively easy. One of the top aspects of a good team is the ability to find work to do when there appears to be no more work. I think we're closing in on finishing the project.
