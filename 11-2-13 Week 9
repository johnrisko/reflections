===========

The past week we divided into our our working groups to tackle the large term project. As an analyzer, my group is composed mostly of analyzers because it appears that the issue we're tackling is the meat of the entire project. I do not know much programming but am learning and will contribute in anyway I can. I think our class is now very organized and we're on the right track to getting this entire project done. 

I think the most useful things we learned in class so far that will help us with this project are the familiarity with GitHub and methods of how we can communicate with eachother. We have communicated on the project effectively and are meeting in our groups to move forward. Also, the survey we took is useful because we centered our analyzer groups around a computer science major who will be the main coder.

What I can personally contribute as of now is organizing and having the depth of knowledge about all the earthquake predictions models to help on the coding. I probably am one of the better communicators in the class and can make sure my own group and the other analyzer groups stay focused. 

Some of the big roadblocks we may encounter are that different groups may progress at different rates. It may be hard to keep every group on the same page as there are many groups with many responsibilities. Effective communication between the groups will be paramount and there needs to be a consistent and timely flow of progress reports and updates.
