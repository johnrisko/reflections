reflections
===========

As the projects are winding down, my groups have accomplished all of our required tasks. We have executive summaries and codes on Github pages which indicate our progress, methods, and problems we have encountered. This may be useful information for people to aggregate and examine for the final pesentation on the twelfth.

The only problem I have is that the next stage is rather confusing so far on what our assignments are. I am coordinating with our grop on the poster and what our assignments are. I will update this post when I recieve confirmation on what to pursue. So far, we have signed up to do do the class takeaways but I keep getting emails for reproducibility. This won't be hard to sort out with good communication methods.
