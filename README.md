===========

This past week we broke into new groups and are beginning the term project. I think it is a really good idea to mix the groups because even thoug I liked working with my original group, since this is a collaborative group project, it is best to know more members of the class and leartn more about our collective strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, I enjoyed meeting with my horizontal group. We started an email thread and are quite enthusiastic to work together and take this project on. I have already recieved help from some of the members in my horizonaal group on methods to enhance my knowledge of python. I have done around 50% of the codeacademy python course, but the new sources are quite helpful in enhancing my knowledge. 

I think it was really useful to go over the new grading rubric for the course. It added a lot of clarity for the expectations of the course and how we can succeed. The only thing I would suggest is that instead of grading participation on GitHub participation, participation should be graded on change and growth in Github participation. There are many in the course who use github for multiple purposes and are able to contribute more to the collaborative effort now. They should be rewarded for their ecxpertise and willingness to help. I do not have much experience with GitHub so I have not contributed too much yet, but I plan on contributing more and more. For participation, I think change in participation should be the grading rubric for how it is graded because as the semester progresses, I and others with little knowledge of programming will become better programmers and more able to help the rest of our class.
