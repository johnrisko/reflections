===========

In this week the course material and accelerated intensely. I do not have much programming experience and am a little lost but am excited to dive in and try and learn and accomplish as much as I can. The biggest challenge I have so far is how quickly the material jumped from installations into data analysis and presentations. I am very excited to learn it but my lack of knowledge in Python is making it somewhat difficult for me to rap my head around. I like the fact we have both horizontal and vertical groups to share responsibilities and help each other through the process. So far, both vertical and horizontal groups have been very responsive in helping others when we feel comnfused. I think that all in all, the class does not have much experience with programming and that's part of the reason everyone is willing to help each other. Professor Stark's presentation was very well done and I believe that the knowledge we will attain in tis process is vital and critical, not only in the research world, but in the job market. I have seen many job descriptions that almost exactly fit the work we're doing in this class: data collecting, organizing, analyzing, and being able to reproduce it. It is hard, but am excited to work hard in learning more.
