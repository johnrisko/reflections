This week was the final week. Although I had to be out of town for the week due to scheduling all my interviews for deadweek. A very important thing this class taught me was how to communicate and keep up to date with the group without being physically able to meet. To accomplish this, Sam (head of the class management thread) and I hadf conversations through emails on what he was looking for our group to do for class amangement. Group 1/3's responsibility became to list out some future methods of collabortion. I updated my group's GitHub page and tried to keep up to date with our progress in finishing the poster. I talked to Arif after the science fair and he told me that the project generated a lot of buzz and was succesful.
