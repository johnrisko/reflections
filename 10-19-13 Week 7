This week Professor Starke outlined the details of our term project and the motivation behind it. I find the new topic more interesting than checking if earthquakes were related to rainfall. I feel improving on earthquake detection by improving the magnitude-dependent alarm system has real world applications and significance.

The biggest problem I see in the future is making collaborative effort as efficient as possible. I think its going to be hard for everyone to coordinate and stay on the same page. The development in the early weeks of learning Github and the irc will be very helpful. I just know personally, I travel most weekends and its harder to coordinate with my team members than most. We've done a very good job at utilizing google hangouts and staying on the same page. 

Another potential trouble may be the continued adaption of Python. Since most of us have not taken CS 61a, most of us do not have formal educations in Pyhton. I have done some of the Code Academy and reading "Data Analysis for Python". Its challenging scraping the data but I think we will improve as long as we keep plugging along.
