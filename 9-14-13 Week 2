I found the most productive activity this week to be the pluses and deltas activity. I think it helped clear the air of how the students felt about the course so far. The class is experimental so I think an open-feedback environment is necessary for the class to be succeed. I think one of the biggest pluses is the open-environment where we can work in groups. I do not have the technical expertise as some others in my group and it is very helpful to be able to ask my group a question directly during class. Working within a group saves time, and since the problems are usually minor, the problem is resolved quickly without resulting in a hullabaloo.  One of the things I would want to improve is the clarity of the instructions. I think the work done in class would be more accomplished if we download the necessary programs outside of class and perform the technical steps in class. The teachers can provide step-by-step instructions and people within groups can help eachother because some will have easier times than others. Additionally, a list of tasks for each class period would be very helpful in orgnaizing tasks and monitoring progress.  

Going forward, as the work bevcomes more technical, I think organization is going to be more necessary. As students we have the responsibility of helping each other outside of class.  This class is collaborative which requires participation from all the members.  Some of the good ideas that were brought up in the activity were creating the list of terminology and people who are experiencing difficulties voicing their problems over adium. I think we'll get better at organizing and making sure everyone is on the same page as the semester continues.
