reflections
===========

In class we had two guest-lecturers come and talk about the term project.  THe first guest speaker discussed using the presence of toads in Yosemite Park to measure ecological health. I found the lecture was very intellectually engaging, especially the use of statistics to model toad presence and using the presence of toads as a parameter to estimate the health of the park. 

I do not know how the 2nd lecture on Earthquakes tied into the first lecture, but I enjoyed both.  The second lecture was more technical, discussing parametric estimators for earthquakes. This This would be a fascinating term project, but seemingly quite difficult. My knowledge of statistics allowed me to follow the lecture almost completely, but I have not studied F-tests. I can contribute on the statistical aspects of the project, but I don't know how much I can contribute on the computing since I only recently started learning Python.

I think the class is really starting to come together and get on the same page. Although I was already caught up, I think the Friday office hours was beneficial in getting people on the same page before we start to get into the bulk of the work. Regular office hours will help make sure people do npot get left behind as the work becomes more technical.
